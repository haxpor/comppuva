# Note

- As of Feb, 29, 2020, the template `Makefile-template` and `template-main.cpp` were updated with
  new additional of `ArrayInputParser` to parse python-like input integer array/2d-array. Some of older
  solution source files still base on modified `testcases.txt` format to accomodate the reading inputs though.
